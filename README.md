# Open Player

HTML5 video and audio player

Inspired by [MediaElementJS](http://mediaelementjs.com) and [Plyr](https://plyr.io/), this player adapts to the most popular libraries/APIs to play a variety of media, such as native MP4/MP3, HLS, M(PEG)-DASH, YouTube, Vimeo, etc.

A few key features:

* Allows playing with Chromecast and AirPlay, as well as Ads using Google IMA SDK library.
* Simplified markup and highly customizable skin using only CSS and SVG for icons.
* Mimics native HTML5 methods and events, and incorporates some new ones.
