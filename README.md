# OpenPlayer.js

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rafa8626/openplayer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rafa8626/openplayer)

## What is it?

Inspired by [MediaElementJS](http://mediaelementjs.com) and [Plyr](https://plyr.io/), this player mimics the HTML5 video/audio methods/events/properties, and integrates the most popular libraries to play different types of native media, such as MP4/MP3, HLS and M(PEG)-DASH.

## Why OpenPlayer?

* **Less than `20KB`** using gzip compression and minification.
* **Monetize video and audio content** with video advertising using [Interactive Media Ads SDK](https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/) library.
* **Simplified markup** and **highly customizable CSS** (even specific styling for high contrast mode). See https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2010/01/high-contrast-proof-css-sprites/ for more details.
* Third-party libraries use **ever-green scripts**.
* **Responsive** and **fill** mode.
* Support for **local and remote captions**.
* **No dependencies**, since this player is written in Typescript.
