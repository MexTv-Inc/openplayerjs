# Open Player

HTML5 video and audio player

Inspired by [MediaElementJS](http://mediaelementjs.com) and [Plyr](https://plyr.io/), this player written in TypeScript mimics the HTML5 video/audio and integrates the most popular libraries/APIs to play a variety of media, such as native MP4/MP3, HLS, M(PEG)-DASH, YouTube, Vimeo, etc.

A few key features:

* Allows playing media via Chromecast and AirPlay.
* Allows playing Ads using Google IMA SDK library.
* Simplified markup and highly customizable skin using only CSS and SVG for icons.
* Third-party libraries use ever-green scripts (if you plan to use the player as a Node module, considering appending them or installing them via `npm`)
