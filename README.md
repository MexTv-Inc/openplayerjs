# Open Player

HTML5 video and audio player

Inspired by [MediaElementJS](http://mediaelementjs.com) and [Plyr](https://plyr.io/), this player written in TypeScript mimics the HTML5 video/audio and integrates the most popular libraries to play the different native media, such as MP4/MP3, HLS and M(PEG)-DASH.

## Features

* Less than `20KB` using gzip compression and minification.
* Allows playing Ads using Google IMA SDK library.
* Simplified markup and highly customizable skin using only CSS (even specific styling for high contrast mode).
* Third-party libraries use ever-green scripts (if you plan to use the player as a Node module, considering appending them or installing them via `npm`)
